# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About me 

I’m an experienced front-end developer who like to dapple in full stack development. Currently based in the UK.

Outside programming I’m learning foreign languages, currently Spanish. I like to travel and experienced new places. My goal is to be able to work and travel while trying out my languages skills.

## 👨‍💻 Working on

Foreign language website that finds unique words from selected text and stores them in a ‘stack’ so I can go about learning them.

Open sourced foreign language journal website called [Journaly](https://github.com/Journaly/journaly) that I like to contribute when I have time.
